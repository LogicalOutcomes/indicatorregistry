"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"According to the Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI), benchmarks for this metric will largely depend on variability factors, such as income, age, and household composition. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b) 
No specific guidance is provided for the measurement of the data element. The preferred benchmarks may vary within organizations. Nevertheless, the result of the data element will be expressed in percentages and a possible method to measure the deviation between two or more periods is to calculate the percent change. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

The pre/post intervention score is the average pre/post score of all participants. The average score of all participants  is the sum of the scores of all questions divided by the total number of answers to all questions. These calculations are performed for each survey period and then the periods are compared.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Chart templates are provided below.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion."

(Government of Canada, 2015)
Two questions are selected out of a large population survey covering dozens of topics (including health conditions, smoking, exercise, food security, waiting times for health care, etc.).
"	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Very satisfied = 2
• Satisfied = 1
• Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied = 0
• Dissatisfied = -1
• Very dissatisfied = -2
• Refuse to answer = 0
• Don't know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very satisfied” x 2) + (number of responses to “Satisfied” x 1)+ (number of responses to “Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied” x 0) + (number of responses to “Dissatisfied” x -1) + (number of responses to “Very dissatisfied” x -2) + (number of responses to “Refuse to answer” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very satisfied”) + (number of responses to “Satisfied”)+ (number of responses to “Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied”) + (number of responses to “Dissatisfied”) + (number of responses to “Very dissatisfied”) + (number of responses to “Refuse to answer”) + (number of responses to “Don't know”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

"The University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Center for Financial Security developed an instrument to assess financial capability in 2011. The instrument, an eight item survey, was created from the findings of the “Financial Coaching Outcomes Measures Project” that sought to define a short list of standardized measures reliable enough to be considered benchmarks for assessing one’s financial health. Four organizations (Bon Secours, the Financial Clinic, LISC Chicago and the University of Wisconsin-Extension) aggregated their data for client outcomes, in order to identify which measures were consistently used across service providers. The data was then assessed to determine which measures were reliable and valid for evaluating one’s financial health. Once the eight measures were identified, they were again tested both individually and as a composite scale using cross sections of aggregated data from the four organizations to determine their predictive ability for an area of financial health. This scale is designed and validated specifically to assess outcomes of financial counselling interventions (Collins & O’Rourke, 2013).
All questions out of a total of 8 items including a qualitative response were selected from this instrument. 
"	"The authors of the Financial Capability Scale (FCS) suggest the following method to measure the data element at the start of a program and again at a later date:

Over the last 3 months, have you followed a personal budget, spending plan, or financial plan?
• Yes = 1
• No = 0

Although the Financial Capability Scale is presented along with a method to use and measure the instrument, no clear indication exists as to how to measure the change in score between two time periods. A complementary method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion or at a certain time after the end of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Yes = 1
• No = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “ No ” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “ No ”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex. 

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"The University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Center for Financial Security developed an instrument to assess financial capability in 2011. The instrument, an eight item survey, was created from the findings of the “Financial Coaching Outcomes Measures Project” that sought to define a short list of standardized measures reliable enough to be considered benchmarks for assessing one’s financial health. Four organizations (Bon Secours, the Financial Clinic, LISC Chicago and the University of Wisconsin-Extension) aggregated their data for client outcomes, in order to identify which measures were consistently used across service providers. The data was then assessed to determine which measures were reliable and valid for evaluating one’s financial health. Once the eight measures were identified, they were again tested both individually and as a composite scale using cross sections of aggregated data from the four organizations to determine their predictive ability for an area of financial health. This scale is designed and validated specifically to assess outcomes of financial counselling interventions (Collins & O’Rourke, 2013).
All questions out of a total of 8 items including a qualitative response were selected from this instrument. 
"	"The authors of the Financial Capability Scale (FCS) suggest the following method to measure the data element at the start of a program and again at a later date:

Do you currently have an automatic deposit or electronic transfer set up to put money away for a future use such as saving for retirement or education? 
• Yes = 1
• No = 0

Although the Financial Capability Scale is presented along with a method to use and measure the instrument, no clear indication exists as to how to measure the change in score between two time periods. A complementary method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion or at a certain time after the end of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Yes = 1
• No = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “ No ” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “ No ”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

"The University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Center for Financial Security developed an instrument to assess financial capability in 2011. The instrument, an eight item survey, was created from the findings of the “Financial Coaching Outcomes Measures Project” that sought to define a short list of standardized measures reliable enough to be considered benchmarks for assessing one’s financial health. Four organizations (Bon Secours, the Financial Clinic, LISC Chicago and the University of Wisconsin-Extension) aggregated their data for client outcomes, in order to identify which measures were consistently used across service providers. The data was then assessed to determine which measures were reliable and valid for evaluating one’s financial health. Once the eight measures were identified, they were again tested both individually and as a composite scale using cross sections of aggregated data from the four organizations to determine their predictive ability for an area of financial health. This scale is designed and validated specifically to assess outcomes of financial counselling interventions (Collins & O’Rourke, 2013).
All questions out of a total of 8 items including a qualitative response were selected from this instrument. 
"	"The authors of the Financial Capability Scale (FCS) suggest the following method to measure the data element at the start of a program and again at a later date:

In the last 3 months, have you paid a late fee on a loan or bill?
• Yes = 1
• No = 0

Six of the 8 questions in the FCS include “Don’t know” answer option. According to the authors, this was a deliberate and perhaps debatable choice. In many cases, a “don’t know” response likely means “No” and is coded as such. In other cases, “don’t know” indicates a lack of financial awareness that might be a negative signal. In general, it is better to force clients to answer the question (Collins & O’Rourke, 2013).

The adopted approach for measuring the “Don’t know” answer option in the current indicator reference sheet is to code it the same as “No” answer options (0 points).

Although the Financial Capability Scale is presented along with a method to use and measure the instrument, no clear indication exists as to how to measure the change in score between two time periods. A complementary method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Yes = 1
• No = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “ No ” x 0)) 

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “ No ”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

If credit score can be obtained, even given limitations in coverage, it remains a clear measure with
accepted benchmarks for quality (for example, 580, 620, 680, 720 and 750). Even if credit score can be
obtained, other items from the credit report appear valuable, including:

• # items in collections
• # items judgments (public records section)
• A. $ revolving credit limit (mainly credit cards, not HELOCs)

Given the cost and difficulty of pulling credit reports on behalf of clients, one alternative might be to
develop online tools to help clients pull and extract key items from the annualcreditreport.com website.
This would require ongoing client cooperation but could be a promising option for some programs.

Once the eight measures were identified, they were again tested both individually and as a composite scale using cross sections of aggregated data from the four organizations to determine their predictive ability for an area of financial health. This scale is designed and validated specifically to assess outcomes of financial counselling interventions (Collins & O’Rourke, 2013).

"	"Change in financial capability is a composite indicator that is calculated as the sum of the scores of the following question of the Financial Capability Scale:

1. Over the last 3 months, have you followed a personal budget, spending plan, or financial plan?
• Yes = 1
• No = 0

2. How confident are you in your ability to achieve a financial goal you set for yourself today?
• Not at all confident = 0
• Somewhat confident = 1
• Very confident = 2

3. If you had an unexpected expense or someone in your family lost a job, got sick or had another emergency, how confident are you that your family could come up with money to make ends meet within a month?
• Not at all confident = 0
• Somewhat confident = 1
• Very confident = 2

4. Do you currently have an automatic deposit or electronic transfer set up to put money away for a future use such as saving for retirement or education? 
• Yes = 1
• No = 0

5. In the last 3 months, did you use an automatic deposit or transfer to put money away for a future use such as saving for retirement or education?
• Yes = 1
• No = 0

6. In the last 3 months, have you paid a late fee on a loan or bill?
• Yes = 1
• No = 0


Interpreting FCS levels based on results of the scale can be done by using the following cutoffs: 1= ""Low FCS"" 2 = ""Moderate FCS"" 3= ""High FCS"" where (0/3 total points=1); (4/5 total points=2); (6/8 total points=3). 
Essentially, if the sum of the answers to all questions above is between 0 and 3 points, one is scoring low on financial capability. Total points between 4 and 5 give a moderate financial capability assessment and a score between 6 and 8 points award a high financial capability. 
A complementary method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the financial capability - Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score.

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.

"	"Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

To calculate the pre and post intervention scores follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the average score of all participants
The average score of all participants is the sum of the scores of all questions divided by the total number of answers to all questions. The average score will be between 0 and 8 points.

2. Use the following cutoffs to determine whether the average financial capability is Low = 1; Moderate =2 or High =3”:
• 0/3 total points = 1
• 4/5 total points = 2
• 6/8 total points = 3

These calculations are performed for each survey period and then the periods are compared.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Chart templates are provided below.

The chart illustrates the percent change in the financial capability score before and after the program, disaggregated by sex. A targeted percent change could be added and measured against.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

Expenses higher than income are an indication of instability and potential growth of financial liabilities.	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

Cash flow analysis of an individual’s total monthly income compared to their total monthly expenses
Green: Expenses < Income 
Yellow: Expenses = Income 
Red: Expenses > Income 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.


"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Expenses < Income = 2
• Expenses = Income = 1
• Expenses > Income = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Expenses < Income” x 2) + (number of responses to “Expenses = Income” x 1) + (number of responses to “Expenses > Income” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Expenses < Income”) + (number of responses to “Expenses = Income”) + (number of responses to “Expenses > Income”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results.

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

FinMgmt115	The indicator indicates money management behaviour in relation to the ability to keep up with monthly expenses and bills. Difficulties in keeping up with monthly expenses and bills indicate money management problems and potential decrease of credit standing.	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

In a typical month, how difficult is it for your household to cover your expenses and pay all your bills? 
Green: Not at all difficult 
Yellow: Somewhat difficult 
Red: Very difficult 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.

"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Not at all difficult = 2
• Somewhat difficult = 1
• Very difficult = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Not at all difficult” x 2) + (number of responses to “Somewhat difficult” x 1) + (number of responses to “Very difficult” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Not at all difficult”) + (number of responses to “Somewhat difficult”) + (number of responses to “Very difficult”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex. 

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results.

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

Which best describes the timing of bill payments (including debt) in relation to payment dates? 
Green: Pay full amount 
Yellow: Pay minimum 
Red: Pay less than minimum 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Pay full amount = 2
• Pay minimum = 1
• Pay less than minimum = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Pay full amount” x 2) + (number of responses to “Pay minimum” x 1) + (number of responses to “Pay less than minimum” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Pay full amount”) + (number of responses to “Pay minimum”) + (number of responses to “Pay less than minimum”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex. 

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results.

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Keeping up with all bills and payments without any difficulties” x 3) + (number of responses to “Keeping up with all bills and payments, but it is a struggle from time to time” x 2) + (number of responses to “Keeping up with all bills and payments, but it is a constant struggle” x 1) + (number of responses to “Falling behind with some bills or credit payments” x 0) + (number of responses to “Falling behind with many bills or credit payments” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Keeping up with all bills and payments without any difficulties”) + (number of responses to “Keeping up with all bills and payments, but it is a struggle from time to time”) + (number of responses to “Keeping up with all bills and payments, but it is a constant struggle”) + (number of responses to “Falling behind with some bills or credit payments”) + (number of responses to “Falling behind with many bills or credit payments”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

Creating automatic mechanisms allows people to avoid exercising self-control; self-imposed constraints indicate behavioral goals.	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

Automatic deposit or electronic transfer has been set up to put money away for future use? 
Green: Setup 
Yellow: No setup 
Red: n/a 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
• Setup = 1
• No setup = 0
• n/a = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Setup” x 1) + (number of responses to “No setup” x 0) + (number of responses to “n/a” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Setup”) + (number of responses to “No setup”) + (number of responses to “n/a”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Financial Health Metrics
Retirement account balances	Retirement account balances	Savings;Behaviour	Retirement account balances are increasing	FinSav122	The indicator shows the movement of retirement accounts balances. Regular savings are indication of good financial health. The increase of the savings accounts is an indication of change in financial behaviour.	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

Retirement account balances are increasing? 
Green: Increasing 
Yellow: Staying the same
Red: Decreasing 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
• Increasing = 2
• Staying the same = 1
• Decreasing = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Increasing” x 2) + (number of responses to “Staying the same” x 1) + (number of responses to “Decreasing” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Increasing”) + (number of responses to “Staying the same”) + (number of responses to “Decreasing”))

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex. 

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Save regularly by putting money aside each month = 2
• Have automatic deposit or electronic transfer set up to put money away for future use (such as savings) = 2
• Save income of one family member, spend the other = 2
• Spend regular income, save other income = 2
• Save whatever is left over at the end of the month - no regular plan = 1
• Don't save - usually spend more than income = 0
• Don't save - usually spend about as much as income = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Save regularly by putting money aside each month” x 2) + (number of responses to “Have automatic deposit or electronic transfer set up to put money away for future use (such as savings)” x 2) + (number of responses to “Save income of one family member, spend the other” x 2) + (number of responses to “Spend regular income, save other income” x 2) + (number of responses to “Save whatever is left over at the end of the month - no regular plan” x 1) + (number of responses to “Don't save - usually spend about as much as income” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don't save - usually spend more than income” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Save regularly by putting money aside each month”) + (number of responses to “Have automatic deposit or electronic transfer set up to put money away for future use (such as savings)”) + (number of responses to “Save income of one family member, spend the other”) + (number of responses to “Spend regular income, save other income”) + (number of responses to “Save whatever is left over at the end of the month - no regular plan”) + (number of responses to “Don't save - usually spend about as much as income”) + (number of responses to “Don't save - usually spend more than income”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results.

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

FinSav125	The indicator is intended to measure the ability of households to deal with unexpected shock or  unplanned expenses. Having savings sets aside suggests self-control and/or intention to exercise control.	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

How much does your household have in non-retirement savings?  
Green: 6 or more months of living expenses 
Yellow: 3-5 months of living expenses 
Red: Less than 3 months of living expenses 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• On due date or before = 2
• Soon after due date (within 10 days) = 1
• Well after due date (after 10 days) = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “On due date or before” x 2) + (number of responses to “Soon after due date (within 10 days)” x 1) + (number of responses to “Well after due date (after 10 days)” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following ((number of responses to “On due date or before”) + (number of responses to “Soon after due date (within 10 days)”) + (number of responses to “Well after due date (after 10 days”))

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results.

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

Amount of debt payments in relation to amount due   
Green: Pay full amount 
Yellow: Pay partial amount, pay minimum 
Red: Pay less than minimum 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Pay full amount = 2
• Pay partial amount, pay minimum = 1
• Pay less than minimum = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Pay full amount” x 2) + (number of responses to “Pay partial amount, pay minimum” x 1) + (number of responses to “Pay less than minimum” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following ((number of responses to “Pay full amount”) + (number of responses to “Pay partial amount, pay minimum”) + (number of responses to “Pay less than minimum”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

Financial Health Metrics
Financial obligation ratio	Financial obligation ratio	Consumer credit;Behaviour	Financial Obligations Ratio	FinCredit129	The indicator measures the ratio of financial obligations to disposable income. Sustainable debt amounts are one of the indications of financial health.	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

Financial Obligations Ratio
Green: Under 15% = good 
Yellow: 15-20% = caution zone 
Red: Over 20% = no more debt  

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
• Under 15% = good = 2
• 15-20% = caution zone = 1
• Over 20% = no more debt = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Under 15% = good” x 2) + (number of responses to “15-20% = caution zone” x 1) + (number of responses to “Over 20% = no more debt” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Under 15% = good”) + (number of responses to “15-20% = caution zone”) + (number of responses to “Over 20% = no more debt”))

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Pay credit cards in full = 2
• Generally make more than the minimum payment, but carry over a balance and pay interest = 1
• Generally make the minimum payment only, but carry over a balance and pay interest = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Pay credit cards in full” x 2) + (number of responses to “Generally make more than the minimum payment, but carry over a balance and pay interest” x 1) + (number of responses to “Generally make the minimum payment only, but carry over a balance and pay interest” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following ((number of responses to “Pay credit cards in full”) + (number of responses to “Generally make more than the minimum payment, but carry over a balance and pay interest”) + (number of responses to “Generally make the minimum payment only, but carry over a balance and pay interest”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results.

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

How would you rate your credit score?  
Green: Good, Excellent 
Yellow: Fair 
Red: Poor, Very Poor 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score.

• Excellent = 3
• Good = 2
• Fair = 1
• Poor  = 0
• Very Poor = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Excellent” x 3) + (number of responses to “Good” x 2) + (number of responses to “Fair” x 1) + (number of responses to “Poor” x 0) + (number of responses to “Very poor” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following ((number of responses to “Excellent”) + (number of responses to “Good”) + (number of responses to “Fair”) + (number of responses to “Poor”) + (number of responses to “Very poor”))

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option.

"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

Number of months of living expenses available in household accounts?  
Green: More than 3 months 
Yellow: 1-3 months 
Red: Less than 1 month 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• More than 3 months = 2
• 1-3 months = 1
• Less than 1 month = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “More than 3 months” x 2) + (number of responses to “1-3 months” x 1) + (number of responses to “Less than 1 month” x 0)

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following ((number of responses to “More than 3 months”) + (number of responses to “1-3 months”) + (number of responses to “Less than 1 month”)

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results.

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

Does main earner(s) with dependents in your household have life insurance?  
Green: Yes 
Yellow: n/a 
Red: No 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Yes = 1
• N/a = 0
• No = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “N/a” x 0) + (number of responses to “No” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “N/a”) + (number of responses to “No”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results.

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score

FinMgmt139	This indicator measures  the change in emergency funds set aside. Contingency funds provide liquidity and signal planning and foresight.	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

Thinking about your household’s finances today, how financially prepared do you feel your household is for the unexpected?
Green: Very prepared
Yellow: Somewhat prepared or Only a little prepared
Red: Not at all prepared

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
• Very prepared = 2
• Somewhat prepared or Only a little prepared = 1
• Not at all prepared = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very prepared” x 2) + (number of responses to “Somewhat prepared or Only a little prepared” x 1) + (number of responses to “Not at all prepared” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very prepared”) + (number of responses to “Somewhat prepared or Only a little prepared”) + (number of responses to “Not at all prepared”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

Having a financial plan suggests self-control and/or intention to exercise control and increased the possibility of achieving financial goals.	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

Identified/named savings goal(s) on accounts (i.e. college fund, vacation fund, investment fund)
Green: Yes 
Yellow: n/a 
Red: No 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
• Yes = 1
• n/a = 0
• No = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “n/a” x0) + (number of responses to “No” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “n/a”) + (number of responses to “No”))

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

• No or We would if we could = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes or We do not need a budget because we always have enough money” x 1) + (number of responses to “n/a” x 0) + (number of responses to “No or We would if we could” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “ Yes or We do not need a budget because we always have enough money ”) + (number of responses to “ n/a”) + (number of responses to “ No or We would if we could ”))

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

Do you have a plan to achieve your longer-term financial goals?
Green: Yes 
Yellow: n/a 
Red: No 

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
• Yes = 1
• n/a = 0
• No = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “n/a” x 0) + (number of responses to “No” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “n/a”) + (number of responses to “No”))

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option.

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately.

The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

FinMgmt146	The indicator provides information about financial engagement and financial awareness. Seeking financial information prevents people from using unhealthy products or taking on unsustainable debt when the need for extra money arises.	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

When making a large financial decision, do you know where to go for advice or information?
Green: Yes
Yellow: Sometimes
Red: No

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
• Yes = 2
• Sometimes = 1
• No = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 2) + (number of responses to “Sometimes” x 1) + (number of responses to “No” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “Sometimes”) + (number of responses to “No”))

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Very satisfied = 3
• Satisfied = 2
• Neither satisfied nor unsatisfied = 1
• Unsatisfied = 0
• Very unsatisfied = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very satisfied ” x 3) + (number of responses to “Satisfied ” x 2) + (number of responses to “Neither satisfied nor unsatisfied” x 1) + (number of responses to “Unsatisfied” x 0) + (number of responses to “Very unsatisfied” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following ((number of responses to “Very satisfied ”) + (number of responses to “Satisfied ”) + (number of responses to “Neither satisfied nor unsatisfied”) + (number of responses to “Unsatisfied”) + (number of responses to “Very unsatisfied”))

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results.

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

FinGoals149	"This indicator is intended to measure the level of satisfactions with one's household situation. Positive financial attitudes and perceptions (satisfaction, stress, confidence) facilitate change in financial behavior. "	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

How would you rate your household’s financial situation today?
Green: Excellent or Good
Yellow: Fair
Red: Poor

Confidence in ability to reach household's financial goals	Confidence in ability to reach household's financial goals	Goals progress;Knowledge-Attitudes-Skills-Aspirations	How confident are you in your ability to reach your household's financial goals?	FinGoals151	This indicator is intended to measure the level of confidence about one's ability to achieve financial goals. Confidence and self-actualization are needed to change behavior.	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation, as part of their Consumer Financial Health Study (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015a), identified eight indicators that would adequately assess financial health. Originally, 20 indicators were identified through the review of data collected from interviews with subject matter experts and other stakeholders, and corroborating the study’s findings against that of 20 external consumer finance studies. This list was then refined down to eight key indicators that would give an adequate overall view of a person’s financial health.
Each indicator has two forms of metrics that collect financial data and survey data respectively. Choosing which metric to use will depend on a service provider’s needs. Overall, financial data has a more quantitative focus that will objectively assess a person’s behavior. Survey data focuses on the attitudes and perceptions a person holds about their financial health. The indicators can be used individually, or as a composite scale. Similarly, the metrics for each indicator can be used separately or in tandem with each other. Questions are drawn from or inspired by a variety of sources. (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)
40 items were included in the list of indicators, out of a total of 41. Note that many items in this instrument are answered by a counsellor on the basis of a document review (e.g., bank statements) rather than survey questions to participants.
"	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) has developed a method to measure the financial health indicators, using a color scheme. “Next to each metric, we provide suggested benchmarks for how to interpret the data collected. While it is hard to say where the cutoff should be between financially healthy and unhealthy behaviors and attitudes, it is easier to show progress in the direction that we want to see consumers moving. Our draft benchmarks indicate this direction by providing benchmarks in three different colors: green shows behaviors/attitudes that will move someone in the direction of greater financial health; yellow shows behaviors/attitudes that neither move someone significantly toward or away from greater financial health; and red shows behaviors/attitudes that will detract someone from the direction of greater financial health.” (Center for Financial Services Innovation, 2015b)

The CFSI benchmark for interpreting the data collected for this indicator is presented below:

How confident are you in your ability to reach your household's financial goals?
Green: Very confident
Yellow: Somewhat confident
Red: Not at all confident

Color coding is a good way to visually represent an individual’s financial health condition but it might not be the most suitable tool for measurement of financial empowerment program success for two reasons: 1) It does not provide a clear unit measurement to track program’s progress 2) It does not provide information about the contribution of each answer option.

An alternative method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
• Very confident = 2
• Somewhat confident = 1
• Not at all confident = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very confident” x 2) + (number of responses to “Somewhat confident” x 1) + (number of responses to “Not at all confident” x 0))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very confident”) + (number of responses to “Somewhat confident”) + (number of responses to “Not at all confident”))

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Yes = 1
• No = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “No” x 0)) 

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “No”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Bank = 3
• Credit union or caisse populaire = 2
• Cheque cashing and payday loan services (e.g. Money Mart) = 1
• I don't use any financial services = 0
• Other = 1

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Bank” x 3) + (number of responses to “ Credit union or caisse populaire” x 2) + (number of responses to “Cheque cashing and payday loan services (e.g. Money Mart)” x 1) + (number of responses to “I don't use any financial services” x 0) + (number of responses to “Other” x 1))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Bank” ) + (number of responses to “ Credit union or caisse populaire ”) + (number of responses to “ Cheque cashing and payday loan services (e.g. Money Mart)” ) + (number of responses to “ I don't use any financial services ”) + (number of responses to “ Other ”))

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Yes = 1
• No = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “No” x 0)) 

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “No”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

16 questions were taken from a post-intervention survey of 36 items. "	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Yes = 0
• No = 1
• Don't know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 0) + (number of responses to “No” x 1)+ (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0)) 

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “No”)+(number of responses to “Don't know”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"The FCAC’s ""Financial literacy self-assessment quiz"" is a 30-item questionnaire that assesses an individual's financial literacy skills and knowledge. The questions were taken from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a national survey carried out by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2014). Many of the questions from the FCAC quiz are also included in a ‘Personal Financial Literacy Quiz’ developed by Prosper Canada and included in their Financial Literacy Evaluation Resource Kit (see above). 
The Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) 2014 sheds light on Canadians’ knowledge, abilities and behaviour concerning financial decision-making - in other words, how Canadians understand their financial situation, the financial services available to them and their plans for the future. The survey is designed to collect information surrounding respondents’ approaches to day-to-day money management and budgeting, longer term money management and general financial planning.  The CFCS was designed to be collected by telephone interview, an approach that reflected previous successes in other countries with similar subject matter. A first round of cognitive testing, including one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions, across Canada in spring 2007 confirmed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. With the addition of Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada as active partners, the content was modified to reflect each of the partners’ data needs. This led to a second round of cognitive testing in only a few selected cities in the spring of 2008. The computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application was developed and tested during the summer and fall months in 2008. In an attempt to maintain comparability, the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey has kept the 2009 CFCS’s content intact, making only very slight updates where necessary. The 2014 application was then re-developed and tested in the early months of 2014 (Arrowsmith & Pignal, 2007), (Arrowsmith, Pignal, & Kleim, 2006). 
6 questions out of a total of 29 were selected from the Financial Literacy Self-Assessment Quiz.
"	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Agree = 1
• Disagree = 0
• Don't know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Agree” x 1) + (number of responses to “ Disagree ” x 0)+ (number of responses to “ Don't know ” x 0)) 

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Agree”) + (number of responses to “ Disagree ”)+(number of responses to “ Don't know ”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Very good = 3
• Good = 2
• Fairly good = 1
• Not very good = 0
• I don't know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very good” x 3) + (number of responses to “Good” x 2) + (number of responses to “Fairly good” x 1) + (number of responses to “Not very good” x 0) + (number of responses to “I don’t know” x 0)) 

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very good”) + (number of responses to “Good”) + (number of responses to “Fairly good”) + (number of responses to “Not very good”) + (number of responses to “I don’t know”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"	"The FCAC’s ""Financial literacy self-assessment quiz"" is a 30-item questionnaire that assesses an individual's financial literacy skills and knowledge. The questions were taken from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a national survey carried out by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2014). Many of the questions from the FCAC quiz are also included in a ‘Personal Financial Literacy Quiz’ developed by Prosper Canada and included in their Financial Literacy Evaluation Resource Kit (see above). 
The Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) 2014 sheds light on Canadians’ knowledge, abilities and behaviour concerning financial decision-making - in other words, how Canadians understand their financial situation, the financial services available to them and their plans for the future. The survey is designed to collect information surrounding respondents’ approaches to day-to-day money management and budgeting, longer term money management and general financial planning.  The CFCS was designed to be collected by telephone interview, an approach that reflected previous successes in other countries with similar subject matter. A first round of cognitive testing, including one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions, across Canada in spring 2007 confirmed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. With the addition of Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada as active partners, the content was modified to reflect each of the partners’ data needs. This led to a second round of cognitive testing in only a few selected cities in the spring of 2008. The computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application was developed and tested during the summer and fall months in 2008. In an attempt to maintain comparability, the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey has kept the 2009 CFCS’s content intact, making only very slight updates where necessary. The 2014 application was then re-developed and tested in the early months of 2014 (Arrowsmith & Pignal, 2007), (Arrowsmith, Pignal, & Kleim, 2006). 
6 questions out of a total of 29 were selected from the Financial Literacy Self-Assessment Quiz.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

Seeking financial information prevents people from using unhealthy products or taking on unsustainable debt when the need for extra money arises.	"The FCAC’s ""Financial literacy self-assessment quiz"" is a 30-item questionnaire that assesses an individual's financial literacy skills and knowledge. The questions were taken from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a national survey carried out by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2014). Many of the questions from the FCAC quiz are also included in a ‘Personal Financial Literacy Quiz’ developed by Prosper Canada and included in their Financial Literacy Evaluation Resource Kit (see above). 
The Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) 2014 sheds light on Canadians’ knowledge, abilities and behaviour concerning financial decision-making - in other words, how Canadians understand their financial situation, the financial services available to them and their plans for the future. The survey is designed to collect information surrounding respondents’ approaches to day-to-day money management and budgeting, longer term money management and general financial planning.  The CFCS was designed to be collected by telephone interview, an approach that reflected previous successes in other countries with similar subject matter. A first round of cognitive testing, including one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions, across Canada in spring 2007 confirmed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. With the addition of Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada as active partners, the content was modified to reflect each of the partners’ data needs. This led to a second round of cognitive testing in only a few selected cities in the spring of 2008. The computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application was developed and tested during the summer and fall months in 2008. In an attempt to maintain comparability, the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey has kept the 2009 CFCS’s content intact, making only very slight updates where necessary. The 2014 application was then re-developed and tested in the early months of 2014 (Arrowsmith & Pignal, 2007), (Arrowsmith, Pignal, & Kleim, 2006). 
6 questions out of a total of 29 were selected from the Financial Literacy Self-Assessment Quiz."	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Very good = 3
• Good = 2
• Fairly good = 1
• Not very good = 0
• I don't know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very good” x 3) + (number of responses to “Good” x 2) + (number of responses to “Fairly good” x 1) + (number of responses to “Not very good” x 0) + (number of responses to “I don’t know” x 0)) 

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very good”) + (number of responses to “Good”) + (number of responses to “Fairly good”) + (number of responses to “Not very good”) + (number of responses to “I don’t know”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

"Most Significant Change (MSC) is a qualitative technique for participatory monitoring and evaluation that is widely used in front-line services in developing nations (Dart & Davies, 2003). 
SC [Significant Change] stories are collected from those most directly involved, such as participants and field staff. The stories are collected by asking a simple question such as: ‘During the last month, in your opinion, what was the most significant change that took place for participants in the program?’ It is initially up to respondents to allocate their stories to a domain category. In addition to this, respondents are encouraged to report why they consider a particular change to be the most significant one. (Davies & Dart, 2005)

As a participatory technique MSC can be adapted in many ways. Validity is provided through a process of transparency and verification, described in the User Guide. 
The use of qualitative ‘Significant Change’ questions from MSC offers a rich complement to the quantitative indicators. The questions provide a relatively unfiltered voice to both participants and front line staff, and enable them to communicate the issues that are important to them even if they are not captured by closed-ended questions. 

The MSC questions can be adapted to the vocabulary of the participants (e.g., ‘Thinking about the whole program, what was the most important change for you?’). The responses are sent to staff at least once a month to act as an ongoing opportunity to respond to concerns of participants. It also enables organizations to check on the logic model of the program as seen by participants – what is actually important to them? – and provides stories for stakeholders and funders. The analysis requires some time. Most importantly, personal details must be disguised to protect client confidentiality, and participants must be asked permission to share their stories. If results are to be reported quantitatively, someone must code and categorize the responses. But in most cases, agencies do not need to code responses – they just need to read them, mine from them and learn. 

There are two steps to the MSC technique. First, each participant is asked to describe the most significant change they experienced as a result of the program. Next, staff are asked to select the most significant story and pass it up to the next level of the organization. The agency ends up with a set of powerful vignettes to share with funders and stakeholders. Agencies should read the instruction guide if they wish to use the entire approach (Davies & Dart, 2005).

Having and following a budget or financial plan suggests self-control and/or intention to exercise control.	"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian equivalent of the Government of Canada’s FCAC, recently launched a national survey of financial attitudes and behaviours (ASIC, 2014). The tracker was developed to inform financial literacy programs and initiatives for adult Australians, and supplements the ANZ Survey of Adult Financial Literacy in Australia which is carried out every three years. 
The tracker provides a snapshot of key financial attitudes and behaviours at regular intervals and covers five factors of financial literacy: 
• Keeping track of finances – approaches to managing everyday expenses
• Planning ahead – planning for the medium and longer term, including retirement and beyond
• Choosing financial products – shopping around and understanding and assessing investment risk
• Staying informed – use of information, tools and guidance when needed
• Financial control – savings behaviour and managing debts

The survey questions include items that are relevant to higher-income respondents (e.g., “Which of the following things have happened with your investments over the last 6 months?”) and thus fill some gaps from the other instruments. In addition, the questions cover a 6 month timeframe rather than the 12 month timeframe of most Statistics Canada surveys and so are more feasible in pre-post designs.

"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian equivalent of the Government of Canada’s FCAC, recently launched a national survey of financial attitudes and behaviours (ASIC, 2014). The tracker was developed to inform financial literacy programs and initiatives for adult Australians, and supplements the ANZ Survey of Adult Financial Literacy in Australia which is carried out every three years. 
The tracker provides a snapshot of key financial attitudes and behaviours at regular intervals and covers five factors of financial literacy: 
• Keeping track of finances – approaches to managing everyday expenses
• Planning ahead – planning for the medium and longer term, including retirement and beyond
• Choosing financial products – shopping around and understanding and assessing investment risk
• Staying informed – use of information, tools and guidance when needed
• Financial control – savings behaviour and managing debts

The survey questions include items that are relevant to higher-income respondents (e.g., “Which of the following things have happened with your investments over the last 6 months?”) and thus fill some gaps from the other instruments. In addition, the questions cover a 6 month timeframe rather than the 12 month timeframe of most Statistics Canada surveys and so are more feasible in pre-post designs.

• Keeping track of finances – approaches to managing everyday expenses
• Planning ahead – planning for the medium and longer term, including retirement and beyond
• Choosing financial products – shopping around and understanding and assessing investment risk
• Staying informed – use of information, tools and guidance when needed
• Financial control – savings behaviour and managing debts

The survey questions include items that are relevant to higher-income respondents (e.g., “Which of the following things have happened with your investments over the last 6 months?”) and thus fill some gaps from the other instruments. In addition, the questions cover a 6 month timeframe rather than the 12 month timeframe of most Statistics Canada surveys and so are more feasible in pre-post designs.

Ability to handle a major unexpected expense	Ability to handle a major unexpected expense	Money management;Impact;Behavior;Knowledge-Attitudes-Skills-Aspirations	I could handle a major unexpected expense	FinMgmt189	This indicator measures the change in the ability to handle a major unexpected expense.	"The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale contains 10 questions [and an abbreviated 5-item version]. These questions were selected through a state-of-the-art process that involved: 
 
• A series of cognitive interviews to ensure that people understand the questions and what they are designed to ask. 
• Factor analysis to select the questions that best measured the underlying concept of interest. 
• Three rounds of psychometric testing with over fifteen thousand respondents in order to select the questions that provided the greatest reliability across adults. 
 
[The] scale incorporates consumers’ perceptions of financial well-being to deliver a single financial well-being score that captures the four elements of financial well-being. The scale is constructed so that it is possible to compare different people’s scores directly, or to see how an individual’s financial well-being changes over time. 
 
The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale can be used in a variety of ways, including: 
• Initial assessment: The scale can be used to assess a person’s financial well-being at intake. In addition, reviewing individual questions that make up the scale with a person that you serve could also help guide a conversation about their financial situation, both strengths and needs, in terms that resonate with and motivate consumers. -
• Tracking individual progress: The scale can be used to track changes in an individual’s financial well-being over time. While not providing the same quantifiable measure of progress as a financial well-being score, changes in answers to individual items may provide additional, more nuanced insights into how individuals are experiencing their financial situation over time. Such changes may highlight an individual’s progress in taking more control over money management, or building stronger protections against financial shocks. 
• Assessing program outcomes: The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale provides a tool to measure the extent to which programs are improving the financial well-being of the individuals that they serve. The scale could be used as part of reports on the effectiveness of programs and services, such as financial education and capability programs. It can also be used to compare different populations in one program—for example, how a particular intervention differentially affects different people—or to compare changes in financial well-being across programs. 
• Financial well-being survey research: The scale can be used in survey research to analyze the relationship between financial well-being and other factors.
"	"The authors of the CFPB FINANCIAL WELL-BEING SCALE provide the following scores of each answer option of the data element:
• Completely = 4 
• Very well =  3
• Somewhat =  2
• Very little = 1 
• Not at all = 0
The score used for the CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale is based on an Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis. IRT is a statistical method that provides a more precise measure than a simple summary score. IRT gives us more precise individual estimates because it allows different items in a scale, and people’s responses to these items, to contribute differently to the final score. 
Once you have a respondent’s completed questionnaire, determining their Financial Well-Being Scale score is a two-step process:
Step 1: Determine the total response value (or raw total): Using the scoring worksheet (http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201512_cfpb_financial-well-being-worksheet-standard.pdf), enter into the right-hand column the number from 0 to 4 that corresponds to each of the person’s responses, and add them up to find the sum total. This is the “total response value” you will use in Step 2.

Step 2: Convert the total response value to a CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale score: On the second page of the scoring worksheet, locate the total response value from Step 1 in the first column, then follow the row across to the appropriate column based on the respondent’s age group and whether or not the respondent read the questionnaire to themselves (“self-administered”), or had the questions read to them by someone else (“administered by someone else”). This will give you the respondent’s CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale score. 

Full guidance to the calculation and interpretation of the financial well-being score is provided in the following documents:

The ability to secure financial future	The ability to secure financial future	Goals progress;Behaviour	I am securing my financial future	FinGoals190	This indicator measures the change in the ability to plan and secure financial future	"The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale contains 10 questions [and an abbreviated 5-item version]. These questions were selected through a state-of-the-art process that involved: 
 
• A series of cognitive interviews to ensure that people understand the questions and what they are designed to ask. 
• Factor analysis to select the questions that best measured the underlying concept of interest. 
• Three rounds of psychometric testing with over fifteen thousand respondents in order to select the questions that provided the greatest reliability across adults. 
 
[The] scale incorporates consumers’ perceptions of financial well-being to deliver a single financial well-being score that captures the four elements of financial well-being. The scale is constructed so that it is possible to compare different people’s scores directly, or to see how an individual’s financial well-being changes over time. 
 
The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale can be used in a variety of ways, including: 
• Initial assessment: The scale can be used to assess a person’s financial well-being at intake. In addition, reviewing individual questions that make up the scale with a person that you serve could also help guide a conversation about their financial situation, both strengths and needs, in terms that resonate with and motivate consumers. -
• Tracking individual progress: The scale can be used to track changes in an individual’s financial well-being over time. While not providing the same quantifiable measure of progress as a financial well-being score, changes in answers to individual items may provide additional, more nuanced insights into how individuals are experiencing their financial situation over time. Such changes may highlight an individual’s progress in taking more control over money management, or building stronger protections against financial shocks. 
• Assessing program outcomes: The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale provides a tool to measure the extent to which programs are improving the financial well-being of the individuals that they serve. The scale could be used as part of reports on the effectiveness of programs and services, such as financial education and capability programs. It can also be used to compare different populations in one program—for example, how a particular intervention differentially affects different people—or to compare changes in financial well-being across programs. 
• Financial well-being survey research: The scale can be used in survey research to analyze the relationship between financial well-being and other factors.
"	"The authors of the CFPB FINANCIAL WELL-BEING SCALE provide the following scores of each answer option of the data element:
• Completely = 4 
• Very well =  3
• Somewhat =  2
• Very little = 1 
• Not at all = 0
The score used for the CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale is based on an Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis. IRT is a statistical method that provides a more precise measure than a simple summary score. IRT gives us more precise individual estimates because it allows different items in a scale, and people’s responses to these items, to contribute differently to the final score. 
Once you have a respondent’s completed questionnaire, determining their Financial Well-Being Scale score is a two-step process:
Step 1: Determine the total response value (or raw total): Using the scoring worksheet (http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201512_cfpb_financial-well-being-worksheet-standard.pdf), enter into the right-hand column the number from 0 to 4 that corresponds to each of the person’s responses, and add them up to find the sum total. This is the “total response value” you will use in Step 2.

Step 2: Convert the total response value to a CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale score: On the second page of the scoring worksheet, locate the total response value from Step 1 in the first column, then follow the row across to the appropriate column based on the respondent’s age group and whether or not the respondent read the questionnaire to themselves (“self-administered”), or had the questions read to them by someone else (“administered by someone else”). This will give you the respondent’s CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale score.

Personal saving habits 	Personal saving habits 	Savings;Behaviour;Knowledge-Attitudes-Skills-Aspirations 	I am concerned that the money I have or will save won’t last	FinSav194	This indicator measures the change in personal saving habits 	"The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale contains 10 questions [and an abbreviated 5-item version]. These questions were selected through a state-of-the-art process that involved: 
 
• A series of cognitive interviews to ensure that people understand the questions and what they are designed to ask. 
• Factor analysis to select the questions that best measured the underlying concept of interest. 
• Three rounds of psychometric testing with over fifteen thousand respondents in order to select the questions that provided the greatest reliability across adults. 
 
[The] scale incorporates consumers’ perceptions of financial well-being to deliver a single financial well-being score that captures the four elements of financial well-being. The scale is constructed so that it is possible to compare different people’s scores directly, or to see how an individual’s financial well-being changes over time. 
 
The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale can be used in a variety of ways, including: 
• Initial assessment: The scale can be used to assess a person’s financial well-being at intake. In addition, reviewing individual questions that make up the scale with a person that you serve could also help guide a conversation about their financial situation, both strengths and needs, in terms that resonate with and motivate consumers. -
• Tracking individual progress: The scale can be used to track changes in an individual’s financial well-being over time. While not providing the same quantifiable measure of progress as a financial well-being score, changes in answers to individual items may provide additional, more nuanced insights into how individuals are experiencing their financial situation over time. Such changes may highlight an individual’s progress in taking more control over money management, or building stronger protections against financial shocks. 
• Assessing program outcomes: The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale provides a tool to measure the extent to which programs are improving the financial well-being of the individuals that they serve. The scale could be used as part of reports on the effectiveness of programs and services, such as financial education and capability programs. It can also be used to compare different populations in one program—for example, how a particular intervention differentially affects different people—or to compare changes in financial well-being across programs. 
• Financial well-being survey research: The scale can be used in survey research to analyze the relationship between financial well-being and other factors.
"	"The authors of the CFPB FINANCIAL WELL-BEING SCALE provide the following scores of each answer option of the data element:
• Completely = 0
• Very well =  1
• Somewhat =  2
• Very little = 3 
• Not at all = 4
The score used for the CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale is based on an Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis. IRT is a statistical method that provides a more precise measure than a simple summary score. IRT gives us more precise individual estimates because it allows different items in a scale, and people’s responses to these items, to contribute differently to the final score. 
Once you have a respondent’s completed questionnaire, determining their Financial Well-Being Scale score is a two-step process:
Step 1: Determine the total response value (or raw total): Using the scoring worksheet (http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201512_cfpb_financial-well-being-worksheet-standard.pdf), enter into the right-hand column the number from 0 to 4 that corresponds to each of the person’s responses, and add them up to find the sum total. This is the “total response value” you will use in Step 2.

Step 2: Convert the total response value to a CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale score: On the second page of the scoring worksheet, locate the total response value from Step 1 in the first column, then follow the row across to the appropriate column based on the respondent’s age group and whether or not the respondent read the questionnaire to themselves (“self-administered”), or had the questions read to them by someone else (“administered by someone else”). This will give you the respondent’s CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale score. 

Full guidance to the calculation and interpretation of the financial well-being score is provided in the following documents:

CFPB Financial well-being scale
Ability to control finances	Ability to control finances	Money management;Behaviour	My finances control my life	FinMgmt198	This indicator measures the change in ability to control finances	"The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale contains 10 questions [and an abbreviated 5-item version]. These questions were selected through a state-of-the-art process that involved: 
 
• A series of cognitive interviews to ensure that people understand the questions and what they are designed to ask. 
• Factor analysis to select the questions that best measured the underlying concept of interest. 
• Three rounds of psychometric testing with over fifteen thousand respondents in order to select the questions that provided the greatest reliability across adults. 
 
[The] scale incorporates consumers’ perceptions of financial well-being to deliver a single financial well-being score that captures the four elements of financial well-being. The scale is constructed so that it is possible to compare different people’s scores directly, or to see how an individual’s financial well-being changes over time. 
 
The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale can be used in a variety of ways, including: 
• Initial assessment: The scale can be used to assess a person’s financial well-being at intake. In addition, reviewing individual questions that make up the scale with a person that you serve could also help guide a conversation about their financial situation, both strengths and needs, in terms that resonate with and motivate consumers. -
• Tracking individual progress: The scale can be used to track changes in an individual’s financial well-being over time. While not providing the same quantifiable measure of progress as a financial well-being score, changes in answers to individual items may provide additional, more nuanced insights into how individuals are experiencing their financial situation over time. Such changes may highlight an individual’s progress in taking more control over money management, or building stronger protections against financial shocks. 
• Assessing program outcomes: The CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale provides a tool to measure the extent to which programs are improving the financial well-being of the individuals that they serve. The scale could be used as part of reports on the effectiveness of programs and services, such as financial education and capability programs. It can also be used to compare different populations in one program—for example, how a particular intervention differentially affects different people—or to compare changes in financial well-being across programs. 
• Financial well-being survey research: The scale can be used in survey research to analyze the relationship between financial well-being and other factors.
"	"The authors of the CFPB FINANCIAL WELL-BEING SCALE provide the following scores of each answer option of the data element:
• Always = 0
• Often =  1
• Sometimes = 2  
• Rarely =  3
• Never = 4
The score used for the CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale is based on an Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis. IRT is a statistical method that provides a more precise measure than a simple summary score. IRT gives us more precise individual estimates because it allows different items in a scale, and people’s responses to these items, to contribute differently to the final score. 
Once you have a respondent’s completed questionnaire, determining their Financial Well-Being Scale score is a two-step process:
Step 1: Determine the total response value (or raw total): Using the scoring worksheet (http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201512_cfpb_financial-well-being-worksheet-standard.pdf), enter into the right-hand column the number from 0 to 4 that corresponds to each of the person’s responses, and add them up to find the sum total. This is the “total response value” you will use in Step 2.

Step 2: Convert the total response value to a CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale score: On the second page of the scoring worksheet, locate the total response value from Step 1 in the first column, then follow the row across to the appropriate column based on the respondent’s age group and whether or not the respondent read the questionnaire to themselves (“self-administered”), or had the questions read to them by someone else (“administered by someone else”). This will give you the respondent’s CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale score. 

Full guidance to the calculation and interpretation of the financial well-being score is provided in the following documents:

Positive financial attitudes and perceptions (satisfaction, stress, confidence) facilitate change in financial behavior. "	"The research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability”, by Dr. Jennifer Robson and James Splinter, aims to validate the results of a 2012 pilot study that developed a short instrument to
measure financial capability, using national survey results as reference point. The initial 2012 pilot study relied on results from an exploratory factor analysis of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability conducted for the Department of Finance. That work, by Stephen McKay, used the master data file at Statistics Canada to identify relationships between over 50 survey items. The exploratory factor analysis resulted in five separate scales that provided an indirect measurement of five separate hypothesized domains of financial capability:
1. Making ends meet
2. Keeping track of money
3. Planning ahead
4. Choosing products
5. Staying informed
The 2012 pilot study produced a 16-item instrument, referred to as the quiz.  Each item on the quiz is drawn from a question on the national survey questionnaire for the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. The phrasing of some questions was altered slightly to make the instrument suitable for independent administration. All quiz items are treated as ordinal and have at least 3 possible responses. The results of the quiz provide an empirically-based approach to measuring financial capability and represents an improvement over metrics based on expert judgement alone. The quiz is also intended to be used in community settings to support staff in assessing individual financial capability to inform program delivery and support evaluation. The quiz might be used, for example, to screen clients and triage them for different types of intervention based on results. It could also be used to help evaluate programs if organizations are able to administer the quiz in a pre-post design with approximately 12 months in between or where a control group can be used. 
In the pilot phase of this quiz, the lead author was able to indicate, for each quiz item, which answer represented the median response in the national data. Respondents could then evaluate whether their score was above or below that median based on the underlying ordinal scale of the responses. In the 2015 study, that approach was expanded by using the numeric scales in Table 2 (above) to first to calculate the scores on all five domains of financial capability for the 27,555 sample of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability. The distribution of scores in the general adult population was converted to percentaile ranking (by deciles), offering a basis for individual ranking relative to the adult population. In practical terms, users may find the quiz more informative using these decile scales rather than numerical scales. These could be left as they are and individual results would be communicated in terms of a decile position in the population. "	"Making ends meet is a composite indicator whose score is calculated by adding the scores of the contributing questions # 1, # 2 and # 13 of the financial literacy quiz after multiplying them by question factor weight.
The factor weights for the questions composing this indicators are:
q1 = 1
q2 = 1.149
q3 = 0.46

The formula for calculating the indicator score is:
Making Ends Meet (MEM) = q1(1) + q2(1.15)+q13(.46)
For additional information read the full research report and the relevant appendices downloadable from: http://carleton.ca/politicalmanagement/people/jennifer-robson/

The above formula is used for the calculation of the indicator score in the beginning and near the end of a finacial literacy program.
A complementary method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in score - Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score. A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Chart templates are provided below.

The chart illustrates financial capability score before or during the program and after the program completion, disaggregated by sex.

The chart illustrates the percent change in the financial capability score before and after the program, disaggregated by sex. A targeted percent change could be added and measured against.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"	"Planning ahead is a composite indicator whose score is calculated by adding the scores of the contributing questions # 6, # 7 and # 8 of the financial literacy quiz after multiplying them by question factor weight.
The factor weights for the questions composing this indicators are:
q6 = 1
q7 = 1.064
q8 = 0.336

The formula for calculating the indicator score is:
Planning Ahead (PA) = q6(1)+q7(1.06)+q8(.34)

The above formula is used for the calculation of the indicator score in the beginning and near the end of a finacial literacy program.
A complementary method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in score - Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score. A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably."	"Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Chart templates are provided below.

The chart illustrates the percent change in the financial capability score before and after the program, disaggregated by sex. A targeted percent change could be added and measured against.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

Seeking financial information prevents people from using unhealthy products or taking on unsustainable debt when the need for extra money arises.	"The research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability”, by Dr. Jennifer Robson and James Splinter, aims to validate the results of a 2012 pilot study that developed a short instrument to
measure financial capability, using national survey results as reference point. The initial 2012 pilot study relied on results from an exploratory factor analysis of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability conducted for the Department of Finance. That work, by Stephen McKay, used the master data file at Statistics Canada to identify relationships between over 50 survey items. The exploratory factor analysis resulted in five separate scales that provided an indirect measurement of five separate hypothesized domains of financial capability:
1. Making ends meet
2. Keeping track of money
3. Planning ahead
4. Choosing products
5. Staying informed
The 2012 pilot study produced a 16-item instrument, referred to as the quiz.  Each item on the quiz is drawn from a question on the national survey questionnaire for the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. The phrasing of some questions was altered slightly to make the instrument suitable for independent administration. All quiz items are treated as ordinal and have at least 3 possible responses. The results of the quiz provide an empirically-based approach to measuring financial capability and represents an improvement over metrics based on expert judgement alone. The quiz is also intended to be used in community settings to support staff in assessing individual financial capability to inform program delivery and support evaluation. The quiz might be used, for example, to screen clients and triage them for different types of intervention based on results. It could also be used to help evaluate programs if organizations are able to administer the quiz in a pre-post design with approximately 12 months in between or where a control group can be used. 
In the pilot phase of this quiz, the lead author was able to indicate, for each quiz item, which answer represented the median response in the national data. Respondents could then evaluate whether their score was above or below that median based on the underlying ordinal scale of the responses. In the 2015 study, that approach was expanded by using the numeric scales in Table 2 (above) to first to calculate the scores on all five domains of financial capability for the 27,555 sample of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability. The distribution of scores in the general adult population was converted to percentaile ranking (by deciles), offering a basis for individual ranking relative to the adult population. In practical terms, users may find the quiz more informative using these decile scales rather than numerical scales. These could be left as they are and individual results would be communicated in terms of a decile position in the population.

Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• I don't know = 0.75
• Having real financial problems and falling behind = 1.5
• Keeping up but it sometimes is a struggle = 2.25
• Keeping up without any problems = 3

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know” x 0.75) + (number of responses to “Having real financial problems and falling behind” x 1.5)+ (number of responses to “Keeping up but it sometimes is a struggle” x 2.25) + (number of responses to “Keeping up without any problems” x 3))

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know”) + (number of responses to “Having real financial problems and falling behind”)+ (number of responses to “Keeping up but it sometimes is a struggle”) + (number of responses to “Keeping up without any problems”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score

"The research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability”, by Dr. Jennifer Robson and James Splinter, aims to validate the results of a 2012 pilot study that developed a short instrument to
measure financial capability, using national survey results as reference point. The initial 2012 pilot study relied on results from an exploratory factor analysis of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability conducted for the Department of Finance. That work, by Stephen McKay, used the master data file at Statistics Canada to identify relationships between over 50 survey items. The exploratory factor analysis resulted in five separate scales that provided an indirect measurement of five separate hypothesized domains of financial capability:
1. Making ends meet
2. Keeping track of money
3. Planning ahead
4. Choosing products
5. Staying informed
The 2012 pilot study produced a 16-item instrument, referred to as the quiz.  Each item on the quiz is drawn from a question on the national survey questionnaire for the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. The phrasing of some questions was altered slightly to make the instrument suitable for independent administration. All quiz items are treated as ordinal and have at least 3 possible responses. The results of the quiz provide an empirically-based approach to measuring financial capability and represents an improvement over metrics based on expert judgement alone. The quiz is also intended to be used in community settings to support staff in assessing individual financial capability to inform program delivery and support evaluation. The quiz might be used, for example, to screen clients and triage them for different types of intervention based on results. It could also be used to help evaluate programs if organizations are able to administer the quiz in a pre-post design with approximately 12 months in between or where a control group can be used. 
In the pilot phase of this quiz, the lead author was able to indicate, for each quiz item, which answer represented the median response in the national data. Respondents could then evaluate whether their score was above or below that median based on the underlying ordinal scale of the responses. In the 2015 study, that approach was expanded by using the numeric scales in Table 2 (above) to first to calculate the scores on all five domains of financial capability for the 27,555 sample of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability. The distribution of scores in the general adult population was converted to percentaile ranking (by deciles), offering a basis for individual ranking relative to the adult population. In practical terms, users may find the quiz more informative using these decile scales rather than numerical scales. These could be left as they are and individual results would be communicated in terms of a decile position in the population. "	"The score of this data element (question # 2 of the quiz) is derived as a combination of the responses of the following questions:
Thinking of the last 12 months, were you ever behind two months in a row or more... in paying a bill?
… in paying your rent or mortgage?
… in making a loan payment?
The possible answer options to the above questions are:
• I don't know
• Yes
• No
The score of the data element is calculated by assigning points to the possible combination of answers to the above questions. Points are assigned as follows:
• I don't know or Yes to all = 0.5
• Yes or DK to ""rent/mortgage"" and one other = 1
• Yes or DK to ""rent/mortgage"" only = 1.5
• Yes or DK to ""loan"" and ""bill"" = 2
• Yes or DK to ""loan"" or ""bill"" only = 2.5
• No on all 3 = 3

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes or No + I don't know”) + (number of responses to “Yes + Never”)+ (number of responses to “Yes + Rarely”) + (number of responses to “Yes + Usually”) + (number of responses to “Yes + Always”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score

More recent check of account balances indicates higher fiscal responsibility and facilitation of change in financial behavior.	"The research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability”, by Dr. Jennifer Robson and James Splinter, aims to validate the results of a 2012 pilot study that developed a short instrument to
measure financial capability, using national survey results as reference point. The initial 2012 pilot study relied on results from an exploratory factor analysis of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability conducted for the Department of Finance. That work, by Stephen McKay, used the master data file at Statistics Canada to identify relationships between over 50 survey items. The exploratory factor analysis resulted in five separate scales that provided an indirect measurement of five separate hypothesized domains of financial capability:
1. Making ends meet
2. Keeping track of money
3. Planning ahead
4. Choosing products
5. Staying informed
The 2012 pilot study produced a 16-item instrument, referred to as the quiz.  Each item on the quiz is drawn from a question on the national survey questionnaire for the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. The phrasing of some questions was altered slightly to make the instrument suitable for independent administration. All quiz items are treated as ordinal and have at least 3 possible responses. The results of the quiz provide an empirically-based approach to measuring financial capability and represents an improvement over metrics based on expert judgement alone. The quiz is also intended to be used in community settings to support staff in assessing individual financial capability to inform program delivery and support evaluation. The quiz might be used, for example, to screen clients and triage them for different types of intervention based on results. It could also be used to help evaluate programs if organizations are able to administer the quiz in a pre-post design with approximately 12 months in between or where a control group can be used. 
In the pilot phase of this quiz, the lead author was able to indicate, for each quiz item, which answer represented the median response in the national data. Respondents could then evaluate whether their score was above or below that median based on the underlying ordinal scale of the responses. In the 2015 study, that approach was expanded by using the numeric scales in Table 2 (above) to first to calculate the scores on all five domains of financial capability for the 27,555 sample of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability. The distribution of scores in the general adult population was converted to percentaile ranking (by deciles), offering a basis for individual ranking relative to the adult population. In practical terms, users may find the quiz more informative using these decile scales rather than numerical scales. These could be left as they are and individual results would be communicated in terms of a decile position in the population. "	"The answer options of this data element (question # 4 of the quiz) are the following:
• I don't know or I don't have any accounts
• Yearly
• Every two weeks
• Monthly
• Daily
• Weekly

The score of the data element is calculated by assigning points to the answers options, grouped as follows:
• I don't know or I don't have any accounts = 0.75
• Yearly = 1.5
• Every two weeks or Monthly = 2.25
• Daily or Weekly = 3
For additional information read the full research report and the relevant appendices downloadable from: http://carleton.ca/politicalmanagement/people/jennifer-robson/

The above scores are used for the calculation of the indicator score in the beginning and near the end of a finacial literacy program.
To provide numerical indication of the change in the data element use a combination of these two calculation methods: 
I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably. 
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• I don't know or I don't have any accounts = 0.75
• Yearly = 1.5
• Every two weeks or Monthly = 2.25
• Daily or Weekly = 3

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know or I don't have any accounts” x 0.75) + (number of responses to “Yearly” x 1.5)+ (number of responses to “Every two weeks or Monthly” x 2.25) + (number of responses to “Daily or Weekly” x 3)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know or I don't have any accounts”) + (number of responses to “Yearly”)+ (number of responses to “Every two weeks or Monthly”) + (number of responses to “Daily or Weekly”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option.

1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries.

"The research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability”, by Dr. Jennifer Robson and James Splinter, aims to validate the results of a 2012 pilot study that developed a short instrument to
measure financial capability, using national survey results as reference point. The initial 2012 pilot study relied on results from an exploratory factor analysis of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability conducted for the Department of Finance. That work, by Stephen McKay, used the master data file at Statistics Canada to identify relationships between over 50 survey items. The exploratory factor analysis resulted in five separate scales that provided an indirect measurement of five separate hypothesized domains of financial capability:
1. Making ends meet
2. Keeping track of money
3. Planning ahead
4. Choosing products
5. Staying informed
The 2012 pilot study produced a 16-item instrument, referred to as the quiz.  Each item on the quiz is drawn from a question on the national survey questionnaire for the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. The phrasing of some questions was altered slightly to make the instrument suitable for independent administration. All quiz items are treated as ordinal and have at least 3 possible responses. The results of the quiz provide an empirically-based approach to measuring financial capability and represents an improvement over metrics based on expert judgement alone. The quiz is also intended to be used in community settings to support staff in assessing individual financial capability to inform program delivery and support evaluation. The quiz might be used, for example, to screen clients and triage them for different types of intervention based on results. It could also be used to help evaluate programs if organizations are able to administer the quiz in a pre-post design with approximately 12 months in between or where a control group can be used. 
In the pilot phase of this quiz, the lead author was able to indicate, for each quiz item, which answer represented the median response in the national data. Respondents could then evaluate whether their score was above or below that median based on the underlying ordinal scale of the responses. In the 2015 study, that approach was expanded by using the numeric scales in Table 2 (above) to first to calculate the scores on all five domains of financial capability for the 27,555 sample of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability. The distribution of scores in the general adult population was converted to percentaile ranking (by deciles), offering a basis for individual ranking relative to the adult population. In practical terms, users may find the quiz more informative using these decile scales rather than numerical scales. These could be left as they are and individual results would be communicated in terms of a decile position in the population. "	"The score of this data element (question # 6 of the quiz) is derived as a combination of the responses of the following questions:
Are you planning ahead financially for when you get to retirement age?  A plan could include many things like your own savings, government programs, pensions at work, family help, continuing to work, etc.
• I don't know
• No
• Yes
• I'm already retired
AND
How confident are you that your household income in retirement will be what you hope for?
• Don't know
• Not at all confident
• Not very confident
• Fairly confident
• Very confident

The score of the data element is calculated by assigning points to the possible combination of answers to the above questions. Points are assigned as follows:
• No or Don't know + Very or fairly = 0.43
• No or Don't know + Not very = 0.85
• No or Don't know + Not at all or Don't know = 1.28
• Yes or retired + Not at all or Don't know = 1.17
• Yes or Retired + Not very = 2.14
• Yes or Retired + Fairly = 2.57
• Yes or Retired + Very = 3
For additional information read the full research report and the relevant appendices downloadable from: http://carleton.ca/politicalmanagement/people/jennifer-robson/

The above scores are used for the calculation of the indicator score in the beginning and near the end of a finacial literacy program.
To provide numerical indication of the change in the data element use a combination of these two calculation methods: 
I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably. 
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• No or Don't know + Very or fairly = 0.43
• No or Don't know + Not very = 0.85
• No or Don't know + Not at all or Don't know = 1.28
• Yes or retired + Not at all or Don't know = 1.17
• Yes or Retired + Not very = 2.14
• Yes or Retired + Fairly = 2.57
• Yes or Retired + Very = 3

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “No or Don't know + Very or fairly” x 0.43) + (number of responses to “No or Don't know + Not very” x 0.85)+ (number of responses to “No or Don't know + Not at all or Don't know” x 1.28) + (number of responses to “Yes or retired + Not at all or Don't know” x 1.17) + (number of responses to “Yes or Retired + Not very” x 2.14) + (number of responses to “Yes or Retired + Fairly” x 2.57) + (number of responses to “Yes or Retired + Very” x 3)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “No or Don't know + Very or fairly”) + (number of responses to “No or Don't know + Not very”)+ (number of responses to “No or Don't know + Not at all or Don't know”) + (number of responses to “Yes or retired + Not at all or Don't know”) + (number of responses to “Yes or Retired + Not very”) + (number of responses to “Yes or Retired + Fairly”) + (number of responses to “Yes or Retired + Very”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score

Fin-Mgmt-211	This indicator measures the change in the ability to handle a major unexpected expense.	"The research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability”, by Dr. Jennifer Robson and James Splinter, aims to validate the results of a 2012 pilot study that developed a short instrument to
measure financial capability, using national survey results as reference point. The initial 2012 pilot study relied on results from an exploratory factor analysis of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability conducted for the Department of Finance. That work, by Stephen McKay, used the master data file at Statistics Canada to identify relationships between over 50 survey items. The exploratory factor analysis resulted in five separate scales that provided an indirect measurement of five separate hypothesized domains of financial capability:
1. Making ends meet
2. Keeping track of money
3. Planning ahead
4. Choosing products
5. Staying informed
The 2012 pilot study produced a 16-item instrument, referred to as the quiz.  Each item on the quiz is drawn from a question on the national survey questionnaire for the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. The phrasing of some questions was altered slightly to make the instrument suitable for independent administration. All quiz items are treated as ordinal and have at least 3 possible responses. The results of the quiz provide an empirically-based approach to measuring financial capability and represents an improvement over metrics based on expert judgement alone. The quiz is also intended to be used in community settings to support staff in assessing individual financial capability to inform program delivery and support evaluation. The quiz might be used, for example, to screen clients and triage them for different types of intervention based on results. It could also be used to help evaluate programs if organizations are able to administer the quiz in a pre-post design with approximately 12 months in between or where a control group can be used. 
In the pilot phase of this quiz, the lead author was able to indicate, for each quiz item, which answer represented the median response in the national data. Respondents could then evaluate whether their score was above or below that median based on the underlying ordinal scale of the responses. In the 2015 study, that approach was expanded by using the numeric scales in Table 2 (above) to first to calculate the scores on all five domains of financial capability for the 27,555 sample of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability. The distribution of scores in the general adult population was converted to percentaile ranking (by deciles), offering a basis for individual ranking relative to the adult population. In practical terms, users may find the quiz more informative using these decile scales rather than numerical scales. These could be left as they are and individual results would be communicated in terms of a decile position in the population. "	"The authors of the financial literacy quiz provide the following scores of each answer option of the data element (question # 8 of the quiz):
• I couldn't cover that kind of cost or Don't know = 0.5
• Go to a pawnbroker or payday lender = 1
• Borrow from a bank or use a credit card = 1.5 
• Borrow from friends or family = 2
• Sell an asset or personal posession = 2.5 
• Use savings = 3
For additional information read the full research report and the relevant appendices downloadable from: http://carleton.ca/politicalmanagement/people/jennifer-robson/

The above scores are used for the calculation of the indicator score in the beginning and near the end of a finacial literacy program.
To provide numerical indication of the change in the data element use a combination of these two calculation methods: 
I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably. "	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• I couldn't cover that kind of cost or Don't know = 0.5
• Go to a pawnbroker or payday lender = 1
• Borrow from a bank or use a credit card = 1.5 
• Borrow from friends or family = 2
• Sell an asset or personal posession = 2.5 
• Use savings = 3

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I couldn't cover that kind of cost or Don't know” x 0.5) + (number of responses to “Go to a pawnbroker or payday lender” x 1)+ (number of responses to “Borrow from a bank or use a credit card” x 1.5) + (number of responses to “Borrow from friends or family” x 2) + (number of responses to “Sell an asset or personal posession” x 2.5) + (number of responses to “Use savings” x 3)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I couldn't cover that kind of cost or Don't know”) + (number of responses to “Go to a pawnbroker or payday lender”)+ (number of responses to “Borrow from a bank or use a credit card”) + (number of responses to “Borrow from friends or family”) + (number of responses to “Sell an asset or personal posession”) + (number of responses to “Use savings”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex. 

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score

That work, by Stephen McKay, used the master data file at Statistics Canada to identify relationships between over 50 survey items. The exploratory factor analysis resulted in five separate scales that provided an indirect measurement of five separate hypothesized domains of financial capability:
1. Making ends meet
2. Keeping track of money
3. Planning ahead
4. Choosing products
5. Staying informed
The 2012 pilot study produced a 16-item instrument, referred to as the quiz.  Each item on the quiz is drawn from a question on the national survey questionnaire for the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. The phrasing of some questions was altered slightly to make the instrument suitable for independent administration. All quiz items are treated as ordinal and have at least 3 possible responses. The results of the quiz provide an empirically-based approach to measuring financial capability and represents an improvement over metrics based on expert judgement alone. The quiz is also intended to be used in community settings to support staff in assessing individual financial capability to inform program delivery and support evaluation. The quiz might be used, for example, to screen clients and triage them for different types of intervention based on results. It could also be used to help evaluate programs if organizations are able to administer the quiz in a pre-post design with approximately 12 months in between or where a control group can be used. 
In the pilot phase of this quiz, the lead author was able to indicate, for each quiz item, which answer represented the median response in the national data. Respondents could then evaluate whether their score was above or below that median based on the underlying ordinal scale of the responses. In the 2015 study, that approach was expanded by using the numeric scales in Table 2 (above) to first to calculate the scores on all five domains of financial capability for the 27,555 sample of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability. The distribution of scores in the general adult population was converted to percentaile ranking (by deciles), offering a basis for individual ranking relative to the adult population. In practical terms, users may find the quiz more informative using these decile scales rather than numerical scales. These could be left as they are and individual results would be communicated in terms of a decile position in the population. "	"The authors of the financial literacy quiz provide the following scores of each answer option of the data element (question # 10 of the quiz):
• I don't know = 1
• Disagree = 2
• Agree = 3
For additional information read the full research report and the relevant appendices downloadable from: http://carleton.ca/politicalmanagement/people/jennifer-robson/

The above scores are used for the calculation of the indicator score in the beginning and near the end of a finacial literacy program.
To provide numerical indication of the change in the data element use a combination of these two calculation methods: 
I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably. "	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• I don't know = 1
• Disagree = 2
• Agree = 3

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know” x 1) + (number of responses to “Disagree” x 2)+ (number of responses to “Agree” x 3)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know”) + (number of responses to “Disagree”)+ (number of responses to “Agree”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• I don't know = 0.5
• No = 1.5
• Yes = 1

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know” x 0.5) + (number of responses to “No” x 1.5) + (number of responses to “Yes” x 1)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know”) + (number of responses to “No”)+ (number of responses to “Yes”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score

Positive financial attitudes and perceptions (satisfaction, stress, confidence) facilitate change in financial behavior. "	"The research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability”, by Dr. Jennifer Robson and James Splinter, aims to validate the results of a 2012 pilot study that developed a short instrument to
measure financial capability, using national survey results as reference point. The initial 2012 pilot study relied on results from an exploratory factor analysis of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability conducted for the Department of Finance. That work, by Stephen McKay, used the master data file at Statistics Canada to identify relationships between over 50 survey items. The exploratory factor analysis resulted in five separate scales that provided an indirect measurement of five separate hypothesized domains of financial capability:
1. Making ends meet
2. Keeping track of money
3. Planning ahead
4. Choosing products
5. Staying informed
The 2012 pilot study produced a 16-item instrument, referred to as the quiz.  Each item on the quiz is drawn from a question on the national survey questionnaire for the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. The phrasing of some questions was altered slightly to make the instrument suitable for independent administration. All quiz items are treated as ordinal and have at least 3 possible responses. The results of the quiz provide an empirically-based approach to measuring financial capability and represents an improvement over metrics based on expert judgement alone. The quiz is also intended to be used in community settings to support staff in assessing individual financial capability to inform program delivery and support evaluation. The quiz might be used, for example, to screen clients and triage them for different types of intervention based on results. It could also be used to help evaluate programs if organizations are able to administer the quiz in a pre-post design with approximately 12 months in between or where a control group can be used. 
In the pilot phase of this quiz, the lead author was able to indicate, for each quiz item, which answer represented the median response in the national data. Respondents could then evaluate whether their score was above or below that median based on the underlying ordinal scale of the responses. In the 2015 study, that approach was expanded by using the numeric scales in Table 2 (above) to first to calculate the scores on all five domains of financial capability for the 27,555 sample of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability. The distribution of scores in the general adult population was converted to percentaile ranking (by deciles), offering a basis for individual ranking relative to the adult population. In practical terms, users may find the quiz more informative using these decile scales rather than numerical scales. These could be left as they are and individual results would be communicated in terms of a decile position in the population. "	"The authors of the financial literacy quiz provide the following scores of each answer option of the data element (question # 13 of the quiz):
• I don't know = 0.6
• Not very good = 1.2
• Fairly good = 1.8
• Good = 2.3
• Very good = 3

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score

Seeking financial information prevents people from using unhealthy products or taking on unsustainable debt when the need for extra money arises.	"The research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability”, by Dr. Jennifer Robson and James Splinter, aims to validate the results of a 2012 pilot study that developed a short instrument to
measure financial capability, using national survey results as reference point. The initial 2012 pilot study relied on results from an exploratory factor analysis of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability conducted for the Department of Finance. That work, by Stephen McKay, used the master data file at Statistics Canada to identify relationships between over 50 survey items. The exploratory factor analysis resulted in five separate scales that provided an indirect measurement of five separate hypothesized domains of financial capability:
1. Making ends meet
2. Keeping track of money
3. Planning ahead
4. Choosing products
5. Staying informed
The 2012 pilot study produced a 16-item instrument, referred to as the quiz.  Each item on the quiz is drawn from a question on the national survey questionnaire for the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. The phrasing of some questions was altered slightly to make the instrument suitable for independent administration. All quiz items are treated as ordinal and have at least 3 possible responses. The results of the quiz provide an empirically-based approach to measuring financial capability and represents an improvement over metrics based on expert judgement alone. The quiz is also intended to be used in community settings to support staff in assessing individual financial capability to inform program delivery and support evaluation. The quiz might be used, for example, to screen clients and triage them for different types of intervention based on results. It could also be used to help evaluate programs if organizations are able to administer the quiz in a pre-post design with approximately 12 months in between or where a control group can be used. 
In the pilot phase of this quiz, the lead author was able to indicate, for each quiz item, which answer represented the median response in the national data. Respondents could then evaluate whether their score was above or below that median based on the underlying ordinal scale of the responses. In the 2015 study, that approach was expanded by using the numeric scales in Table 2 (above) to first to calculate the scores on all five domains of financial capability for the 27,555 sample of the 2009 Canadian Survey of Financial Capability. The distribution of scores in the general adult population was converted to percentaile ranking (by deciles), offering a basis for individual ranking relative to the adult population. In practical terms, users may find the quiz more informative using these decile scales rather than numerical scales. These could be left as they are and individual results would be communicated in terms of a decile position in the population. "	"The authors of the financial literacy quiz provide the following scores of each answer option of the data element (question # 15 of the quiz):
• I don't know = 0.6
• Not very good = 1.2
• Fairly good = 1.8
• Good = 2.3
• Very good = 3
For additional information read the full research report and the relevant appendices downloadable from: http://carleton.ca/politicalmanagement/people/jennifer-robson/

The above scores are used for the calculation of the indicator score in the beginning and near the end of a finacial literacy program.
To provide numerical indication of the change in the data element use a combination of these two calculation methods: 
I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably. "	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• I don't know = 0.6
• Not very good = 1.2
• Fairly good = 1.8
• Good = 2.3
• Very good = 3

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know” x 0.6) + (number of responses to “Not very good” x 1.2) + (number of responses to “Fairly good” x 1.8) + (number of responses to “Good” x 2.3) + (number of responses to “Very good” x 3)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know”) + (number of responses to “Not very good”) + (number of responses to “Fairly good”) + (number of responses to “Good”) + (number of responses to “Very good”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

"The question was taken from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a national survey carried out by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2014). 
The Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) 2014 sheds light on Canadians’ knowledge, abilities and behaviour concerning financial decision-making - in other words, how Canadians understand their financial situation, the financial services available to them and their plans for the future. The survey is designed to collect information surrounding respondents’ approaches to day-to-day money management and budgeting, longer term money management and general financial planning.  The CFCS was designed to be collected by telephone interview, an approach that reflected previous successes in other countries with similar subject matter. A first round of cognitive testing, including one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions, across Canada in spring 2007 confirmed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. With the addition of Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada as active partners, the content was modified to reflect each of the partners’ data needs. This led to a second round of cognitive testing in only a few selected cities in the spring of 2008. The computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application was developed and tested during the summer and fall months in 2008. In an attempt to maintain comparability, the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey has kept the 2009 CFCS’s content intact, making only very slight updates where necessary. The 2014 application was then re-developed and tested in the early months of 2014 (Arrowsmith & Pignal, 2007), (Arrowsmith, Pignal, & Kleim, 2006). 

ALTERNATE WORDING
For this specific question we have used the wording as suggested in the research report of Jennifer Robson and James Splinter “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability” .
The original wording of the question in the 2009 and 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey is ""Again, thinking of the last 12 months, which one of the following statements best describes how well you and your immediate family have been keeping up with your bills and other financial commitments?""
The wording used by FCAC in the Financial literacy self-assessment quiz is ""In the last 12 months, which one of the following statements best describes how well you and your family have been keeping up with your bills and other financial commitments?"""	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Keeping up with all bills and commitments without any problems = 3
• Keeping up with all bills and commitments, but it is sometimes a struggle = 2
• Having real financial problems and falling behind with bills or financial commitments = 1
• Don't have any bills or financial commitments = 0
• Don’t know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Keeping up with all bills and commitments without any problems” x 3) + (number of responses to “Keeping up with all bills and commitments, but it is sometimes a struggle” x 2) + (number of responses to “Having real financial problems and falling behind with bills or financial commitments” x 1) + (number of responses to “Don't have any bills or financial commitments” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don’t know” x 0)) 

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Keeping up with all bills and commitments without any problems”) + (number of responses to “Keeping up with all bills and commitments, but it is sometimes a struggle”) + (number of responses to “Having real financial problems and falling behind with bills or financial commitments”) + (number of responses to “Don't have any bills or financial commitments”) + (number of responses to “Don’t know”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the percent change in the indicator score before and after the program, disaggregated by sex. A targeted percent change could be added and measured against.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LogicalOutcomes/dhis2-indicators/master/RELATIVE-SHARE-OF-ANSWER-OPTIONS.jpg 

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Yes = 0
• No = 1
• Don't know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 0) + (number of responses to “No” x 1) + (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0)) 

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “No”) + (number of responses to “Don't know”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"The question was taken from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a national survey carried out by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2014). 
The Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) 2014 sheds light on Canadians’ knowledge, abilities and behaviour concerning financial decision-making - in other words, how Canadians understand their financial situation, the financial services available to them and their plans for the future. The survey is designed to collect information surrounding respondents’ approaches to day-to-day money management and budgeting, longer term money management and general financial planning.  The CFCS was designed to be collected by telephone interview, an approach that reflected previous successes in other countries with similar subject matter. A first round of cognitive testing, including one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions, across Canada in spring 2007 confirmed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. With the addition of Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada as active partners, the content was modified to reflect each of the partners’ data needs. This led to a second round of cognitive testing in only a few selected cities in the spring of 2008. The computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application was developed and tested during the summer and fall months in 2008. In an attempt to maintain comparability, the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey has kept the 2009 CFCS’s content intact, making only very slight updates where necessary. The 2014 application was then re-developed and tested in the early months of 2014 (Arrowsmith & Pignal, 2007), (Arrowsmith, Pignal, & Kleim, 2006). 

ALTERNATE WORDING
For this specific question we have used the wording as suggested in the research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability” of Jennifer Robson and James Splinter.
The original wording of the question in the 2009 and 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey is ""In that same time period, were you ever behind two or more consecutive months making a loan payment?""
The wording used by FCAC in the Financial literacy self-assessment quiz is ""In the last 12 months, were you ever behind two or more consecutive months making a loan payment?"""	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

• Yes = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 0) + (number of responses to “No” x 1) + (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0)) 

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “No”) + (number of responses to “Don't know”)).

"The question was taken from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a national survey carried out by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2014). 
The Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) 2014 sheds light on Canadians’ knowledge, abilities and behaviour concerning financial decision-making - in other words, how Canadians understand their financial situation, the financial services available to them and their plans for the future. The survey is designed to collect information surrounding respondents’ approaches to day-to-day money management and budgeting, longer term money management and general financial planning.  The CFCS was designed to be collected by telephone interview, an approach that reflected previous successes in other countries with similar subject matter. A first round of cognitive testing, including one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions, across Canada in spring 2007 confirmed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. With the addition of Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada as active partners, the content was modified to reflect each of the partners’ data needs. This led to a second round of cognitive testing in only a few selected cities in the spring of 2008. The computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application was developed and tested during the summer and fall months in 2008. In an attempt to maintain comparability, the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey has kept the 2009 CFCS’s content intact, making only very slight updates where necessary. The 2014 application was then re-developed and tested in the early months of 2014 (Arrowsmith & Pignal, 2007), (Arrowsmith, Pignal, & Kleim, 2006). "	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Always = 3
• Usually = 2
• Rarely = 1
• Never = 0
• Don't know = 0


To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Always” x 3) + (number of responses to “Usually” x 2) + (number of responses to “Rarely” x 1) + (number of responses to “Never” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0)). 

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Always”) + (number of responses to “Usually”) + (number of responses to “Rarely”) + (number of responses to “Never”) + (number of responses to “Don't know”)) .

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Agree = 1
• Disagre = 0
• Don't know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Agree” x 1) + (number of responses to “Disagree” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Agree” x 1) + (number of responses to “Disagree” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"The question was taken from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a national survey carried out by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2014). 
The Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) 2014 sheds light on Canadians’ knowledge, abilities and behaviour concerning financial decision-making - in other words, how Canadians understand their financial situation, the financial services available to them and their plans for the future. The survey is designed to collect information surrounding respondents’ approaches to day-to-day money management and budgeting, longer term money management and general financial planning.  The CFCS was designed to be collected by telephone interview, an approach that reflected previous successes in other countries with similar subject matter. A first round of cognitive testing, including one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions, across Canada in spring 2007 confirmed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. With the addition of Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada as active partners, the content was modified to reflect each of the partners’ data needs. This led to a second round of cognitive testing in only a few selected cities in the spring of 2008. The computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application was developed and tested during the summer and fall months in 2008. In an attempt to maintain comparability, the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey has kept the 2009 CFCS’s content intact, making only very slight updates where necessary. The 2014 application was then re-developed and tested in the early months of 2014 (Arrowsmith & Pignal, 2007), (Arrowsmith, Pignal, & Kleim, 2006). 

ALTERNATE WORDING
For this specific question we have used the wording as suggested in the research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability” of Jennifer Robson and James Splinter.
The original wording of the question in the 2009 and 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey is ""Are you financially preparing for your retirement either on your own or through an employer pension plan?"""	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score.

• Yes = 1
• No = 0
• Don't know = 0
• I am retired = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “No” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0) + (number of responses to “I am retired” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “No”) + (number of responses to “Don't know”) + (number of responses to “I am retired”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:

• Not very confident = 1
• Not at all confident = 0
• Don’t know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Very confident” x 3) + (number of responses to “Fairly confident” x 2) + (number of responses to “Not very confident” x 1) + (number of responses to “Not at all confident” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don’t know” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question).

FinMgmt230	"The indicator can be used to measure financial engagement and awareness and financial resilience, which are indications to good financial health."	"The question was taken from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a national survey carried out by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2014). 
The Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) 2014 sheds light on Canadians’ knowledge, abilities and behaviour concerning financial decision-making - in other words, how Canadians understand their financial situation, the financial services available to them and their plans for the future. The survey is designed to collect information surrounding respondents’ approaches to day-to-day money management and budgeting, longer term money management and general financial planning.  The CFCS was designed to be collected by telephone interview, an approach that reflected previous successes in other countries with similar subject matter. A first round of cognitive testing, including one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions, across Canada in spring 2007 confirmed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. With the addition of Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada as active partners, the content was modified to reflect each of the partners’ data needs. This led to a second round of cognitive testing in only a few selected cities in the spring of 2008. The computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application was developed and tested during the summer and fall months in 2008. In an attempt to maintain comparability, the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey has kept the 2009 CFCS’s content intact, making only very slight updates where necessary. The 2014 application was then re-developed and tested in the early months of 2014 (Arrowsmith & Pignal, 2007), (Arrowsmith, Pignal, & Kleim, 2006). "	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Yes = 1
• No = 0
• Don't know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “No” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “No”) + (number of responses to “Don't know”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

The original wording of the question in the 2009 and 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey is ""Taking all of the various sources of retirement income into account for your household (including government sources as well as personal and occupational pensions and provisions), how confident are you that your household income in retirement will give you the standard of living you hope for?"""

2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Use savings = 3
• Sell a financial asset or personal possession = 3
• Borrow from a friend or relative = 2
• Use a personal line of credit = 2
• Borrow from a financial institution = 2
• Use a credit card = 2
• Go to a pawnbroker or payday loan service = 1
• Other - Specify = 1
• Would not be able to pay this expenditure = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Use savings” x 3) + (number of responses to “Sell a financial asset or personal possession” x 3) + (number of responses to “Borrow from a friend or relative” x 2) + (number of responses to “Use a personal line of credit” x 2) + (number of responses to “Borrow from a financial institution” x 2) + (number of responses to “Use a credit card” x 2) + (number of responses to “Go to a pawnbroker or payday loan service” x 1) + (number of responses to “Other - Specify” x 1) + (number of responses to “Would not be able to pay this expenditure” x 1)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question).

The original wording of the question in the 2009 and 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey is ""I’ve got a clear idea of the sorts of financial products that I need"""	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Agree = 1
• Disagre = 0
• Don't know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Agree” x 1) + (number of responses to “Disagree” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Agree” x 1) + (number of responses to “Disagree” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion.

"The question was taken from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a national survey carried out by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2014). 
The Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) 2014 sheds light on Canadians’ knowledge, abilities and behaviour concerning financial decision-making - in other words, how Canadians understand their financial situation, the financial services available to them and their plans for the future. The survey is designed to collect information surrounding respondents’ approaches to day-to-day money management and budgeting, longer term money management and general financial planning.  The CFCS was designed to be collected by telephone interview, an approach that reflected previous successes in other countries with similar subject matter. A first round of cognitive testing, including one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions, across Canada in spring 2007 confirmed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. With the addition of Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada as active partners, the content was modified to reflect each of the partners’ data needs. This led to a second round of cognitive testing in only a few selected cities in the spring of 2008. The computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application was developed and tested during the summer and fall months in 2008. In an attempt to maintain comparability, the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey has kept the 2009 CFCS’s content intact, making only very slight updates where necessary. The 2014 application was then re-developed and tested in the early months of 2014 (Arrowsmith & Pignal, 2007), (Arrowsmith, Pignal, & Kleim, 2006).

The original wording of the question in the 2009 and 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey is ""Are there any things that you personally keep an eye on, such as changes in …?"""	"The answer options of this data element are the following:
• The housing market
• The stock market
• The currency (money) market
• Interest rates
• Inflation
• Taxation
• The job market
• Pension plans, and benefits
• Sales of consumer goods and services
• Other
• None of the above

The score of the data element is calculated by assigning points to the answers options, grouped as follows:
• None of the above = 0
• 1 topic = 1
• 2 topics = 1
• 3 topics = 2
• 4 topics = 2
• 5 or more topics = 3

The above scores are used for the calculation of the indicator score in the beginning and near the end of a finacial literacy program.
To provide numerical indication of the change in the data element use a combination of these two calculation methods: 
I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably. 
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• None of the above = 0
• 1 topic = 1
• 2 topics = 1
• 3 topics = 2
• 4 topics = 2
• 5 or more topics = 3

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “None of the above” x 0) + (number of responses to “1 topic” x 1) + (number of responses to “2 topics” x 1) + (number of responses to “3 topics” x 2) + (number of responses to “4 topics” x 2) + (number of responses to “5 or more topics” x 3)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “None of the above.  I don't keep an eye on financial things.”) + (number of responses to “1 topic”) + (number of responses to “2 topics”) + (number of responses to “3 topics”) + (number of responses to “4 topics”) + (number of responses to “5 or more topics”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men.

"The question was taken from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a national survey carried out by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2014). 
The Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) 2014 sheds light on Canadians’ knowledge, abilities and behaviour concerning financial decision-making - in other words, how Canadians understand their financial situation, the financial services available to them and their plans for the future. The survey is designed to collect information surrounding respondents’ approaches to day-to-day money management and budgeting, longer term money management and general financial planning.  The CFCS was designed to be collected by telephone interview, an approach that reflected previous successes in other countries with similar subject matter. A first round of cognitive testing, including one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions, across Canada in spring 2007 confirmed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. With the addition of Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada as active partners, the content was modified to reflect each of the partners’ data needs. This led to a second round of cognitive testing in only a few selected cities in the spring of 2008. The computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application was developed and tested during the summer and fall months in 2008. In an attempt to maintain comparability, the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey has kept the 2009 CFCS’s content intact, making only very slight updates where necessary. The 2014 application was then re-developed and tested in the early months of 2014 (Arrowsmith & Pignal, 2007), (Arrowsmith, Pignal, & Kleim, 2006). 

ALTERNATE WORDING
For this specific question we have used the wording as suggested in the research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability” of Jennifer Robson and James Splinter.
The original wording of the question in the 2009 and 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey is ""In the past five years, have you taken a course or program of study to increase your knowledge and understanding of the economy or financial matters?"""	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• Yes = 1
• No = 0
• Don't know = 0

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes” x 1) + (number of responses to “No” x 0) + (number of responses to “Don't know” x 0)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “Yes”) + (number of responses to “No”) + (number of responses to “Don't know”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

The Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) 2014 sheds light on Canadians’ knowledge, abilities and behaviour concerning financial decision-making - in other words, how Canadians understand their financial situation, the financial services available to them and their plans for the future. The survey is designed to collect information surrounding respondents’ approaches to day-to-day money management and budgeting, longer term money management and general financial planning.  The CFCS was designed to be collected by telephone interview, an approach that reflected previous successes in other countries with similar subject matter. A first round of cognitive testing, including one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions, across Canada in spring 2007 confirmed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. With the addition of Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada as active partners, the content was modified to reflect each of the partners’ data needs. This led to a second round of cognitive testing in only a few selected cities in the spring of 2008. The computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) application was developed and tested during the summer and fall months in 2008. In an attempt to maintain comparability, the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey has kept the 2009 CFCS’s content intact, making only very slight updates where necessary. The 2014 application was then re-developed and tested in the early months of 2014 (Arrowsmith & Pignal, 2007), (Arrowsmith, Pignal, & Kleim, 2006). 

ALTERNATE WORDING
For this specific question we have used the wording as suggested in the research report “A new (and better way) to measure financial capability” of Jennifer Robson and James Splinter.
The original wording of the question in the 2009 and 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey is ""How would you rate yourself on each of the following areas of financial management:
... keeping track of money?"""	"A method of measurement has been developed to enable numerical indication of the change in the data element and to provide representation of the contribution of each answer option to the overall score. This measurement approach is a combination of two separate methods: I. Calculating percent change in the pre and post indicator score; and II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option. 
These two methods, presented in a combination, display a clear indication of a change that has occurred and provide representation of the underlying data. 

A detailed description of how to calculate and present the results is provided below. The terms ‘program’ and ‘intervention’ will be used interchangeably.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score 

When utilizing the above data element, participants would be asked to answer the question at the beginning of the program (pre-survey) and also near the conclusion of the program (post-survey). Calculating the change in responses will provide information about the indicator of how participants have learned to be more fiscally responsible. This option of assessing results displays a clear and intuitive representation of change that has occurred. Percent increase/decrease in the pre-post indicator score is also a good standardized measure that allows comparison between financial empowerment program elements. Ideally, the program could set a numerical standard (target) to measure actual change against desired change.

The change in difference is represented by a percentage number, which shows the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score following the formula: ((post intervention score)-(pre intervention score)/(pre intervention score))*100. The numerator is the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. The denominator is the pre intervention score. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a factor of 100 to present a percentage value.

Calculation of pre and post intervention scores

Pre intervention and post intervention scores are calculated identically, with the difference that pre intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded before the intervention and the post intervention numerator and denominator are calculated using the number of responses recorded after the intervention.

The pre intervention and post intervention scores are arithmetic means, derived by dividing a pre/post numerator to pre/post denominator. 
The pre/post numerator is a composite of the following two data components:
1. Number of responses to each answer option 
2. The score attributed to each answer option
The pre/post numerator is calculated by multiplying the total number of responses of each answer option by the respective score and adding the results. The values attributed to each answer options are as follows:
• I don't know = 0
• Not very good = 0
• Fairly good = 1
• Good = 2
• Very good = 3

To calculate the nominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know” x 0) + (number of responses to “Not very good” x 0) + (number of responses to “Fairly good” x 1) + (number of responses to “Good” x 2) + (number of responses to “Very good” x 3)).

The denominator is the sum of the responses to each answer option (the total responses to the indicator question). 

To calculate the denominator, use the following formula ((number of responses to “I don't know”) + (number of responses to “Not very good”) + (number of responses to “Fairly good”) + (number of responses to “Good”) + (number of responses to “Very good”)).

The pre and post intervention score method described above is used to calculate the aggregate average data element score of all program participants. The individual (personal) score is simply the point assigned to the provided answer option. 

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option (Recommended approach)

This method is used to calculate the relative share of each answer option, expressed in percentages. The relative share of each answer option is calculated separately. The numerator is the number of responses to the respective answer option and the denominator is the total number of responses to the question. The numerator is divided by the denominator and then multiplied by a numerical factor of 100 to create a percentage value. For accurate representation of the data the sum of the relative shares of each answer option must equal a 100% figure. 
These calculations are performed in the beginning of the program, using the data then obtained and at the end of the program with the updated answer options. The results are compared and the changes are analyzed.

Reporting type: 
The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex. 

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score

The results of the measurement could be summarized in a table or chart format. Three chart templates are provided below. Presented altogether, the charts provide comprehensive information of the program score, the change that has occurred, as well as additional information of the underlying data.

The chart illustrates the indicator score before or during the program and the indicator score after the program completion, disaggregated by sex. 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LogicalOutcomes/dhis2-indicators/master/PERCENT-CHANGE-VS-TARGET-Integer.jpg

The chart illustrates the percent change in the indicator score before and after the program, disaggregated by sex. A targeted percent change could be added and measured against.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LogicalOutcomes/dhis2-indicators/master/RELATIVE-SHARE-OF-ANSWER-OPTIONS.jpg 

The chart illustrates the relative share of each answer option of the data element, disaggregated by sex. 

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. Make sure that post intervention results are accompanied by the program dropout rate and that the responses to the pre intervention survey of the people who dropped out are analyzed to determine their impact on post survey results (indicator is in development).

2. When targeted changes in indicator scores are set make sure that the pre intervention score is compared to the maximum possible indicator score to examine the boundaries. This will enable the appropriate target determination and correct interpretation of results. For example, assuming the pre-program indicator score is 0.8 points out of a maximum of 2.0 points the maximum improvement possible is 1.2 points, which is a 150%. When analyzing the results, users should mind the maximum possible change, rather than the intuitive change of 100%.

3. The methods of measurement and the respective chart templates, suggested for reporting might not be comprehensive in presenting and explaining program results. A further calculation, analysis, description and data presentation might be necessary to interpret the results. For example, when examining why female positive change is lower than male positive change, the reason could be that either female had considerably higher score in the beginning of the program (not much room for improvement) or the program did not have such a positive impact on women as it had on men. Further analysis of the pre-post scores is need to reach to a conclusion."	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score

The numerator is a numerical representation of the difference between the post intervention score and the pre intervention score. 
A detailed description of how to calculate the pre intervention and post intervention scores is provided in the “Method of Measurement” section in this document.

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option 

Each answer option in the data element is individually calculated and expressed in percentage values. The numerator is the total number of responses the respective answer option received.
"	"I. Calculating the percent change between the pre and post indicator score

The denominator is the pre intervention score. 
A detailed description of how to calculate the pre intervention score is provided in the “Method of Measurement” section in this document.

II. Calculating the relative share of each answer option 

The denominator is the total number of responses to the indicator question.
